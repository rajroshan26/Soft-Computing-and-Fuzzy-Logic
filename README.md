## Assignment 6
Consider a universe representing room temperature in degree C and other
universe representing relative humidity given by
T = 0.4/16 +0.8/18+1.0/20+1.0/22+0.8/24+0.5/26
H= 0.2/0+0.8/20+1.0/40+0.6/60+0.2/80
Calculate the membership of “ Acceptable Temperature OR Acceptable
Humidity”.
## Assignment 7
Given, following membership functions for fuzzy sets old and young
 ( ) ( )
 ( ) ( )
Where, x is the age of the person. Calculate the value of the following:
1. More or less young
2. Not young and not old
3. Young but not too young
4. Extremely old
## Assignment 8
Given, following relations:
R1 = “x is relevant to y”
R2 = “y is relevant to z”
5
Where
X= {1, 2, 3}
Y= {a,b,c,d}
Z = {one, two}
Assuming appropriate values for R1 and R2, calculate the max-min
composition and max product composition for (3, one).
## Assignment 9
Take different elements of a fuzzy set as user input and defuzzify using
Bisector of area, Centroid of area, Mean of Maximum and Smallest of
maximum.
## Assignment 10
Given, following rules:
Rule 1: If BP is high and temperature is high then health is Poor
Rule2: If BP is normal and temperature is normal then health is Good
Rule 3: If BP is low and temperature is normal then health is Normal.
Take the values of Blood Pressure and Temperature as User input and
determine the health of the person.

decide the time taken in washing
Initialize input parameters like washing time, amount of dirt
etc. -> Initialize fuzzy system with membership function->
Define fuzzy rules->Get fuzzy decision for washing time
prediction
